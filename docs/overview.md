## 🧪 Models Evaluated

The following regression models were trained and tested:

| Model                   | Description                                 |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| **Linear Regression**       | Baseline model – simple and effective ✅ Best Model |
| Polynomial Regression   | Captures nonlinear relationships             |
| Decision Tree Regressor | Rule-based tree learning                    |
| Random Forest Regressor | Ensemble of multiple decision trees         |
| Support Vector Regression (SVR) | Learns complex boundaries using kernel trick |
| Gradient Boosting Regressor | Sequentially builds models to minimize error |

Each model was evaluated using:

- ✅ R² Score (Goodness of fit)
- ✅ RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error)

## 🏆 Key Outcomes

- **Best Model**: `Linear Regression`  
- **R² Score**: 0.94 (example; use your exact value)  
- **Top Feature**: R&D Spend showed the strongest correlation with profit  
- **Observation**: Linear trends dominated the dataset, making simple regression highly effective

## 📝 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for other models  
- Add Ridge/Lasso for regularization and comparison  
- Streamlit/Flask web interface for easy use  
- Deploy as an interactive predictive app
